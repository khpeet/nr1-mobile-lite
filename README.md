# Mobile Lite

## Usage

This application provides similar views to New Relic's curated Mobile UI for a given entity. Currently supports Summary, Crashes, Handled Exceptions, and HTTP Errors pages.

## Getting Started
First, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following command(s) (If you have them installed these commands will return a version number, if not, the commands won't be recognized):

```bash
git --version
npm -v
```

Next, install the [NR1 CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [this link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) and following the instructions (5 minutes or less) to install and setup your New Relic development environment.

Next, clone this repository and update `config.json` with your accountId (**NOTE: This should match the profile you are serving to**). To run the code locally against your New Relic data, execute the following commands:

```bash
nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/khpeet/nr1-mobile-lite.git
cd nr1-mobile-lite
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

## Deploying this Nerdpack

```bash
# To create a new uuid for the nerdpack so that you can deploy it to your account:
# nr1 nerdpack:uuid -g [--profile=your_profile_name]

# To see a list of API keys / profiles available in your development environment:
# nr1 profiles:list

nr1 nerdpack:publish [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:deploy [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
